# 🔥 FLAMES Game (C++)

A simple **FLAMES game** built using **C++**, based on the popular childhood game that predicts the relationship between two people using their names.

This project is created for **learning basic C++ concepts** like strings, loops, conditionals, and logic building.

- **F** – Friends  
- **L** – Love  
- **A** – Affection
